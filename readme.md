## features
* adds epitech header into **.c**, **.cpp**, **.h** files or in a **Makefile**,
following the new header style (2017 and later).

## install
use your favorite vim plugin manager,
with the url `https://github.com/x4m3/vim-epitech.git`.

## usage
run `:TekAddHeader` in normal mode to run the plugin, enter your project name,

the plugin will add the epitech header at the top of your file, inserting
